13A-11 Data List Function MODE 6 Data logging:
Limit Value (minimum) *1 or (maximum) *2 about
the main items of emission control system which
ECM monitors can be confirmed. The value at the
last monitoring is output by ECM as a test result.
09 Heated oxygen sensor (front) monitor (Rich/Lean Switching) Count Test Result and Limit Value (min.) × 1 count
0B Heated oxygen sensor (rear) monitor (Voltage Change)The engine control unit checks the output voltage of the heated oxygen sensor (rear) in order to monitor whether the heated oxygen sensor (rear) output is stuck. HO2S B1 SENSOR2 Change in Volt Test Result and Limit Value (min.)× 19.5 mV
