A/D Converter Commands
----------------------

An[<tttt>]<CR>

	Start sample A analog input channel n [0-F]. tttt is the sample time
	in milliseconds as a hex number.
	Max number is EA60 = 60000, meaning that it's
	not possible to have sample time longer than 1 minute.
	If tttt is not given a sample time of 1000 milliseconds (03E8) is
	 assumed.

	The sample will be reported as:

	    AnvvvvTTTT<CR>

	 Where the n is the input channel, vvvv is hex 16 bit sample number
	 In the case of 10 bit samples the value is scaled to the top 16 bits.
	 To convert back to 10 bits then vvvv >> 6 is needed but to scale
	 to float [0.0 - 1.0] then (vvvv/16#ffff) will be fine.
	 TTTT is the number of milliseconds since last read.
	
an<CR>

	Stop async sampling of channel n. Note that there may be
	command(s) in the output buffer that may arrive after the 
	stop command.

Rn

	Syncrounous read analouge value from channel nn.
	Returns RnvvvvTTTT<CR> or BELL (7) for error

Dn[<tttt>]<CR>

	Start sample A digital input bit counter n [0-F].
	tttt is the sample time	in milliseconds as a hex number.
	Max number is EA60 = 60000, meaning that it's
	not possible to have sample time longer than 1 minute.
	If tttt is not given a sample time of 1000 milliseconds (03E8) is
	 assumed.

	The sample will be reported as:

	    DnccccTTTT<CR>

	 Where the n is the digital channel, cccc is hex 16 bit counter number.
	 Since last read. A read will reset the counter.
	 TTTT is the the number of milliseconds since the last read.

dn<CR>

	Stop reading digital input bit counter n.

En
	Read the digital input bit counter n.
	Reply as:

	    Encccctttt<CR>
